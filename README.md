  ```shell
  npm run build:dev
  ```
  
## Running The Tests

To run the unit tests, first ensure that you have followed the steps above in order to install all dependencies and successfully build the project. Once you have done that, proceed with the following steps.

1. Ensure that the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) CLI is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g karma-cli
